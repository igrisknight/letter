                <p>
                    I hope you're having a wonderful time in Agra with your nani and your mom. I can only imagine the joy on your nani's face as she spends time with her amazing granddaughter.
                    But I have to admit, I miss you so much. The days feel incomplete without your laughter and your presence. Every little thing reminds me of you—our talks, our shared smiles, and the way you make everything better just by being here.
                    I love you more than words can ever express. You’re the light of my life, Nupur, and I’m counting the days until you’re back in my arms.
                    Take care and enjoy every moment there, but know that someone here is missing you terribly.
                    All my love,  
                    Kopis ❤️
                </p>
                <p>Love always,<br>Kopis ❤️</p>
